# Brick Breaker Game

This is a simple **Brick Breaker** game built using **HTML5 Canvas** and **JavaScript**. The objective of the game is to break all the bricks on the screen by controlling a paddle to bounce a ball. As you break bricks, your score increases. If you lose the ball, the game will reset, but the bricks will be restored.
